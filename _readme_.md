# OpenLayers + Parcel

This example demonstrates how the `ol` package can be used with Parcel.

Clone the project.

    git clone git@gist.github.com:8ace58718ab14df8a9b08be68f6b832c.git ol-parcel

Install the project dependencies.

    cd ol-parcel
    npm install

Start the development server.

    npm start

After the initial bundle is created, open http://localhost:1234 to see the result.  Note that you may have to reload the browser after editing files.

Create a bundle for the browser.

    npm run build

Deploy the resources created in the `dist` directory to your production server.
